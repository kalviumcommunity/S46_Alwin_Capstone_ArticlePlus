                text: "New York has long loomed large in the traveller’s imagination, most notably in the olden, jet-setting days when getting there was half the fun. A new book, “Wonder City of the World: New York City Travel Posters,” out this month, coupled with a forthcoming exhibit at Poster House, presents a compelling history of New York City tourism through travel posters. In the retrospective, which starts at the close of the nineteenth century and takes us through the decades, ocean liners give way to airplanes, graphic styles evolve, and skyscrapers climb ever higher. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, one of the recurrent visual symbols of the city, the Twin Towers, fell. New York City tourism declined, and, even as it recovered, the tradition of printed posters had passed its prime. But the images, some of which are gathered below, remain. Together, they depict a cumulative dream of a city forever in motion, still beckoning to be discovered. —Françoise Mouly & Genevieve Bormes",

They demanded a nationwide ban on mifepristone, a pill used in half the abortions in America. The drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for more than twenty years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During the pandemic, the agency began allowing prescriptions to be filled by mail, to accommodate social distancing.",

Founded three decades ago as a legal-defense fund for conservative Christian causes, A.D.F. had become that movement’s most influential arm. In the past dozen years, its lawyers had won fourteen Supreme Court victories, including overturning Roe v. Wade; allowing employer-sponsored health insurance to exclude birth control; rolling back limits on government support for religious organizations; protecting the anonymity of donors to advocacy groups; blocking pandemic-related public-health rules; and establishing the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Capitalizing on its success, A.D.F. had tripled its revenue over that period, to more than a hundred million dollars a year. It now had seventy or so in-house lawyers, including the former solicitors general of Michigan and Nebraska and the former United States Attorney for Missouri. The lawyers sent to Amarillo were Erik Baptist, a former top lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump, and Erin Hawley, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, advised the Attorney General under President George W. Bush, and worked on the team that overturned Roe. (She is married to Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri.)",

Filing the mifepristone case in Amarillo enabled A.D.F. to argue before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who had previously worked as the deputy general counsel of First Liberty Institute—a conservative Christian advocacy organization that has received grants from A.D.F. The summer before, Kacsmaryk’s chambers had chosen an intern from an A.D.F. program for law students; an alumnus of the program is clerking for him this fall.

That alone would be “huge.” (A left-leaning investigative organization called Documented provided me with leaked recordings of the video conference and other events, along with hundreds of pages of internal documents.)",

One of Bauslaugh’s lieutenants offered a potential fund-raising pitch: “If I told you five years ago that you could have invested in Roe being overturned, how much would you have invested in that? If I can tell you now that we are going to protect life even more, how much do you want to invest in that?”",

Social media is now the public sphere. Yes, the major social-media apps are owned by private companies, but, when North Carolina tried to bar sex offenders from using Facebook and other social-media sites, the Supreme Court ruled, in Packingham v. North Carolina, that the government could not restrict people from using “what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.” Last year, as state legislatures across the country were drafting bills to place age restrictions on social-media platforms, I wrote that these laws, though understandable in spirit, were simply too unconstitutional to consider, especially given their unrealistic and clunky enforcement mechanisms, which would have gone well beyond just keeping kids off the platforms.",

The addressee would be mailed a card notifying them that the foreign Communist propaganda was waiting for them and would be destroyed if they didn’t send back a query card within twenty days affirming that they had indeed ordered the propaganda and would still like it to be delivered.",

The investigators had planned a nightlong “blitz”—surveillance, arrest, repeat. Anyone caught stealing would be handcuffed, led to a back room, and questioned: What did you plan to do with these items? Did you take them on behalf of someone else?

A fence may buy a hundred-dollar drill from a booster for thirty bucks, to resell it for sixty. Or he may pay in drugs. In sworn testimony before a House committee on homeland security, Scott Glenn, Home Depot’s vice-president of asset protection, recently accused criminal organizations of recruiting vulnerable people into retail-theft schemes by preying on their need for “fast cash” or fentanyl. A fence may unload boosted goods at a swap meet, or at a store where illicit items are “washed” by commingling them with legitimate ones. Pilfered commodities often wind up online. Early in the pandemic, the pivot to e-commerce yielded new players eager to exploit the rogue freedoms of under-regulated commercial spaces. Amazon, eBay, OfferUp, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace—bazaarland. The detectives in the parking lot, who were detailed to, or working with, the highway patrol’s Organized Retail Crime Task Force, had been trying to keep up. “If we could just get back to the days when we were dealing with the career criminals, it would be more manageable,” Captain Jeff Loftin, who heads a group of investigative units in the C.H.P.’s Southern Division, told me. “Now we’re having to deal with everybody and their brother, and trying to find out who they are.”",

L.P.s are not law-enforcement officers, though some used to be, and they have no arrest powers. In fact, a Home Depot employee can be fired for intervening in a theft. (A company spokesman has said, “No merchandise or other asset is worth risking the life of our associates or customers, which is why we have a strict policy against pursuing a shoplifter in a manner that creates a safety risk for anyone.”) Yet many organized-retail-crime investigations start with an L.P., who, like a private eye, may build a case by logging thefts, compiling names, taking photographs, and covertly following suspects around town. An energetic young L.P. shared with the task-force members a snapshot of a known booster who favored plumbing supplies, and said, “He really likes this store.”",
